## CSV_Cleaner_batch_user_input

This script identifies all .csv fiiles in a folder (user input filepath) and converts them to utf8. It then cleans up the file name and headers to remove unhelpful characters like special characters and spaces, either delting the character or replacing with an underscore
Output is saved in a new subfolder
